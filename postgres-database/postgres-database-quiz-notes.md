chatGPT:
A database schema is a logical representation or blueprint of a database. It defines the structure, organization, and relationships of the data stored in the database. It includes information about tables, columns, data types, constraints, and other aspects of the database.

In the context of databases, a table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns. It represents a specific entity or concept within the database schema. Each table consists of a predefined set of columns, which define the attributes or properties of the entity, and rows, which represent individual records or instances of that entity.

A row, also known as a record or tuple, represents a single instance of an entity or concept stored in a table. It contains a set of values that correspond to the attributes defined in the table's schema. Each row in a table typically represents a unique entry or record in the database.

An attribute, also referred to as a column or field, represents a specific characteristic or property of an entity within a database table. It defines the type of data that can be stored in that column. For example, in a table representing employees, attributes could include "name," "age," "salary," and "department." Other names used to describe attributes include field, property, or column. These terms are often used interchangeably, depending on the context.
