## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the syntax for writing a template literal?
write the value of the name variable using the ${}
- What is "string interpolation"?
replacing values with placeholders

The syntax for writing a template literal in JavaScript is to use backticks (``) instead of single or double quotes. Here's an example:

javascript
const name = 'John';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
In the above example, the string "Hello, " is concatenated with the value of the name variable using the ${} syntax within the template literal.

String interpolation is the process of embedding variables or expressions inside a string literal in order to create a new string that incorporates the values of those variables or expressions. This allows for easier and more readable string concatenation, and is commonly used in languages that support template literals, such as JavaScript. In JavaScript, string interpolation is achieved using template literals, as shown in the example above.
