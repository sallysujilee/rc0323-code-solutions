## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does the `express.json()` middleware do and when would you need it?
 It allows the server to automatically handle and extract JSON data from the request body, making it accessible in the subsequent request handlers or middleware.

 You would need it when you expect to receive JSON data in the request body and want to access that data easily in your route handlers. It eliminates the need for manual parsing of JSON data and simplifies the process of working with JSON payloads in your application.
