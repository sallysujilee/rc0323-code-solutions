## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
A function in JavaScript is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
Start with the "function" keyword and give an optional name. Within the "()", use a comma to separate any parameters, indicate the start of the function's code block with a "{". You can use an optional return statement and close with a "}".
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
You have the function's name and a comma-separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by ()
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
Calling a function is when you just input the function name to give an output whereas a function definition gives a full detail on assigning different variables within itself.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
When defining a function you declare parameters. When calling a function, you pass it as an argument.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
Parameter can be seen as a placeholder for an unknown variable until the argument is passed. The parameter holds the value of the argument.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
The first is that the return statement causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program; the second prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run
