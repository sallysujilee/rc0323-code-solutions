## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
Loops allow you to repeat a process over and over without having to write the same instructions each time you want your program to perform a task
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
The condition tests each time the loop repeats
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
Iteration refers to the process in which the code segment is executed once
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
The condition expression of a while loop gets evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the condition evaluates to true, the loop will continue to execute, and if it evaluates to false, the loop will terminate.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The initialization expression of a for loop gets evaluated before the first iteration of the loop. It is typically used to initialize a loop counter variable.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The condition expression of a for loop gets evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop, just like in a while loop. If the condition evaluates to true, the loop will continue to execute, and if it evaluates to false, the loop will terminate.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The final expression of a for loop gets evaluated at the end of each iteration of the loop. It is typically used to update the loop counter variable.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
he break keyword can be used to exit a loop before its condition expression evaluates to false.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
The ++ increment operator is used to increment a variable by 1. It can be used as a postfix or prefix operator, and it can also be combined with other operators, such as +=.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
You can iterate through the keys of an object using a for...in loop. The loop iterates over the keys of the object, and you can access the values associated with those keys using bracket notation.
