## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the default `flex-direction` of a `flex` container?
The default flex-direction of a flex container is row. This means that the main axis of the flex container runs horizontally and the cross axis runs vertically.
- What is the default `flex-wrap` of a `flex` container?
The default flex-wrap of a flex container is nowrap. This means that the items in the container will not wrap to the next line if they exceed the available space on the main axis.
- What axis do the `justify-content` properties work on?
The justify-content properties work on the main axis of the flex container. This means that they control the positioning of items along the horizontal axis if the flex-direction is set to row, and along the vertical axis if the flex-direction is set to column.
- What axis do the `align-items` properties work on?
The align-items properties work on the cross axis of the flex container. This means that they control the positioning of items along the vertical axis if the flex-direction is set to row, and along the horizontal axis if the flex-direction is set to column.
