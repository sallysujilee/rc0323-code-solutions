## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Why do we log things to the console?
It's a good way to debug and make sure the code is running smoothly.
- What is a "model"?
A "model" is a structure of data that holds the input code.
- Which "document" is being referred to in the phrase Document Object Model?
Document is referred to the main HTML document.
- What is the word "object" referring to in the phrase Document Object Model?
Object refers to the nodes, which are differnet parts that add up into creating the DOM tree.
- What is a DOM Tree?
DOM Tree is a structure made up of different elements that are sectioned out to create its HTML web page.
- Give two examples of `document` methods that retrieve a single element from the DOM.
1) `document.querySelector()`
2) `document.queryCommentEnabled()`
- Give one example of a `document` method that retrieves multiple elements from the DOM at once.
`document.querySelectorAll()`
- Why might you want to assign the return value of a DOM query to a variable?
Same as console,logging - it's good to see what you're working on so you can see its results.
- What `console` method allows you to inspect the properties of a DOM element object?
`console.dir`
- Why would a `<script>` tag need to be placed at the bottom of the HTML content instead of at the top?
It's efficient to let the HTML load first before executing the JavaScript
- What does `document.querySelector()` take as its argument and what does it return?
It uses a CSS Selector and returns the first element.
- What does `document.querySelectorAll()` take as its argument and what does it return?
It takes from the CSS Selector and returns a NodeList, which has all of the elements from that selector.

ChatGPT:
1) We log things to the console to debug and understand our JavaScript code. The console allows us to see the values of variables, the results of function calls, and any error messages that are generated by our code. By logging to the console, we can get a better understanding of what our code is doing and identify and fix any issues that arise.

2) In computer science, a "model" refers to a representation of a system or concept that is used to simulate or analyze the system or concept. In the context of web development, a "model" may refer to a data structure or object that represents data or functionality within an application.

3) The "document" being referred to in the phrase Document Object Model is the HTML document that is loaded in the browser.

4) The word "object" in the phrase Document Object Model refers to the fact that the HTML document is represented as a structured collection of objects in memory, each of which corresponds to an element in the document.

5) A DOM tree is a hierarchical representation of the HTML elements in a web page. Each element in the DOM tree corresponds to an element in the HTML document, and the tree structure represents the relationships between elements on the page.

6) Two examples of document methods that retrieve a single element from the DOM are document.querySelector() and document.getElementById().

7) An example of a document method that retrieves multiple elements from the DOM at once is document.querySelectorAll().

8) Assigning the return value of a DOM query to a variable can be useful if you need to reference the element multiple times in your code, or if you need to manipulate the element in some way.

9) The console.dir() method allows you to inspect the properties of a DOM element object. This method will display the object as a hierarchical listing of its properties and methods in the console.

10) Placing a `<script>` tag at the bottom of the HTML content instead of at the top can improve the performance of the web page by allowing the browser to render the HTML content first, without waiting for the JavaScript code to execute.

11) document.querySelector() takes a CSS selector string as its argument and returns the first element that matches the selector.

12) document.querySelectorAll() takes a CSS selector string as its argument and returns a NodeList that contains all elements that match the selector.
