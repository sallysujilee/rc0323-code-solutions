ChatGPT:
Two examples of media features that can be queried in an @media rule are:

max-width: This feature allows you to specify the maximum width of the viewport in which the CSS styles should be applied. For example, @media (max-width: 768px) will apply styles only when the viewport is 768 pixels or less in width.

orientation: This feature allows you to query the orientation of the device, either portrait or landscape. For example, @media (orientation: landscape) will apply styles only when the device is in landscape orientation.

The HTML meta tag used in mobile-responsive web pages is the viewport meta tag. It allows you to set the width, height, and initial scale of the viewport, which is the area of the browser window where the web page is displayed. By setting the viewport meta tag, you can ensure that your web page displays correctly on different devices with different screen sizes and resolutions. The typical viewport meta tag looks like this:

html
Copy code
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
