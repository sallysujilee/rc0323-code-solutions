## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
Block-level elements affect the document flow due to it occupying the entire horizontal and vertical space, thereby creating a "block". Visually, this creates a series of stacked boxes.
- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
The in-line's ability to flow alongside adjacent content makes them useful for creating text-based content like links and emphasized text, while their limitations make them less suitable for more complex layout requirements.
- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up a full width available
- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
An inline element will only take up as much width as necessary to contain its content, and its height will be determined by the height of its content.
